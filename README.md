# Explorations in Elixir
These are some basic explorations in Elixir.

## Queries
Basically, I'm trying to be ok with having the thought "Hey, I have no idea what is happening." The best tool for that is google (duh...). Anyways, here's the list of things I googled and what prompted the exploration, and what file you can find it in.

### Getting started
1. Elixir: You will need to install it. Look [here.](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html) Also if you're a homebrewer, I believe it's ```brew install elixir```.
2. Scripting: elixir your_script_name.exs

### Some explorations
1. Hello World

While this may seem like a silly exercise, it's not necessarily trivial.
